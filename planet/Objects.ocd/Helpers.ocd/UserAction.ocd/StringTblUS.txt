SequenceHelp=Allows execution of multiple actions in a series. The list will be evaluated from top to bottom. Using 'go to' commands or messages with multiple options, it is also possible to jump between indices in the sequences.
GotoHelp=Sets the current execution point to the given index in the parent sequence.
StopSequenceHelp=Ends the current sequence and resets its progress. On the next execution, the sequence will start from the beginning.
SuspendSequenceHelp=Ends the current sequence and stores its progress. If the action is triggered again, the sequence will be resumed after this action.
WaitHelp=Pauses the current sequence by the specified time and continues with the next action after the pause.
